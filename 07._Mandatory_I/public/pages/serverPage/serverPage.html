    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protocol:</strong>  It specifies how the web browser should communicate with the web server. In this case, it's "https://" which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, indicating a secure, encrypted connection.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Subdomain:</strong> "www" is a commonly used subdomain and typically represents the World Wide Web.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Domain:</strong> "google" is the main domain name, indicating the specific website you're trying to access.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>TLD (Top-Level Domain):</strong>  ".com" is a TLD, which often signifies that it's a commercial website.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Endpoint:</strong>  "/search" is the path or location on the web server where the specific resource or page is located.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Query String:</strong> This part starts with "?" and includes parameters like "client=firefox-b-d" and "=test." These parameters are often used to pass information to the web server for various purposes, such as performing a search ("test" in this case) or customizing the user experience based on the client (Firefox in this case).</li>
