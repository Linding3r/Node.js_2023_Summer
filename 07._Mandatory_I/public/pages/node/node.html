    <h1>Node.js 101 </h1>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to run JavaScript code on the server. 
        It's known for its non-blocking, asynchronous architecture, making it ideal for scalable and real-time applications. 
        Node.js has a vast ecosystem of packages through npm, is cross-platform, offers fast performance via the V8 engine, 
        and boasts a thriving community of developers. It's commonly used for building web servers, APIs, and networked 
        applications, making it a popular choice in modern web development.</p>

    <h3 id="list-item-1" class="h4-center"style="margin-top: 100px;">Package Managers: Maven vs. npm</h3>
    <p>Node.js has a rich ecosystem of open-source packages and modules available through the Node Package Manager (npm). 
        Npm makes it easy to discover and integrate third-party libraries and tools into your Node.js projects.</p>
    <h4 id="h4-left">Maven:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Configuration File:</strong>Maven uses a "pom.xml" (Project Object Model) file to define project metadata, dependencies, and build configurations.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Meta Information:</strong>The "pom.xml" contains metadata about the project, such as its name, version, and description.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong>Maven uses XML-based dependency declarations to specify required libraries and their versions.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Build Life Cycle Methods:</strong>Maven follows a build life cycle with phases like "clean," "compile," "test," and "package" to manage the build process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="h4-left">npm (Node Package Manager):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Configuration File:</strong>npm uses a "package.json" file to manage project configuration and dependencies.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Meta Information:</strong>The "package.json" file includes metadata about the project, such as name, version, and description, similar to the "pom.xml."</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong>npm uses a "dependencies" section to list project dependencies and their versions.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Build Life Cycle Methods:</strong>npm allows the definition of custom scripts in the "scripts" section, facilitating various tasks like building, testing, and running the application.</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="text-box">
            <p>
                If you install the nodemon package, you can use the nodemon command instead of node to start your application. Nodemon will automatically restart
                your application when you make changes to your code, which is useful for development.

    <h3 id="list-item-3" class="h4-center"style="margin-top: 100px;">package.json</h3>
    <p>The package.json file is a critical component of Node.js projects and serves multiple purposes:</p>

    <div class="info-container-no-margin">
        <div class="text-box">
            <p>
                <strong>Dependency Management:</strong> One of the primary purposes of package.json is to manage project dependencies. 
                It contains a list of dependencies (libraries or packages) that your Node.js application relies on. These dependencies 
                can be external packages from the Node Package Manager (NPM) registry or custom modules you've developed. 
                Each dependency is listed along with its version number.
                Example package.json snippet with dependencies:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code-box-right">
            <pre>
            <code id="code-snippet">
{
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.17.1",
        "express-session": "^1.17.3",
    }
}         
            </code>
        </pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="info-container-no-margin">
            <div class="code-box-left">
                <pre>
                <code id="code-snippet">
{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "npm install",
        "start": "node app.js"
    }
}         
                </code>
            </pre>
            </div>
                <p>
                    <strong>Scripts:</strong> package.json can define scripts that are executable via the command line. Common scripts 
                    include starting the application, running tests, or performing build tasks. 
                    These scripts can be customized to suit your project's needs.
                    Example package.json with custom scripts:
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-container-no-margin">
                <p>
                    <strong>Metadata:</strong> package.json contains metadata about the project, 
                    such as the project name, description, author, license, and more.
                    Example package.json metadata:
                </p>
            <div class="code-box-right">
                <pre>
                <code id="code-snippet">
{
    "name": "my-node-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "A simple Node.js application",
    "author": "Lindinger",
    "license": "MIT"
    }      
                </code>
            </pre>
            </div>
            </div>


<p>When you install dependencies using "npm install", it generates a package-lock.json file that locks the 
    specific versions of dependencies to ensure consistent installations across different environments.
    In summary, the package.json file is central to Node.js development, as it manages project dependencies, 
    defines scripts for common tasks, holds project metadata, and ensures version consistency. 
    It's crucial for collaboration, deployment, and maintaining the integrity of your Node.js application.</p>
