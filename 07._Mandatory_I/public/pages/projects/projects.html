    <p>Here is a list of various projects that I have worked on since the start of this Semester of Node.js</p>

    <h4>Mountain API</h4>

    <p>
        This project was created using Node.js and Express.js. It is a REST API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete mountains from a database.
        The API is hosted on VERCEL. <a href="https://mountain-api.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Mountain API</a>

    <h4>Time To Deploy</h4>

    <p>
        This was our first freestyle project with the only requirement that it had to somewhat be about "time". I chose to make a website that gives your facts
        about random inventions. On top of that there is a game where one has to guess the right year of an invention. <a href="https://time-to-deploy.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Time To Deploy</a>
