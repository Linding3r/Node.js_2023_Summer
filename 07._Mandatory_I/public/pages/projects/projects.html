    <p>Here is a list of various projects that I have worked on since the start of this Semester of Node.js</p>
<br>
    <h4>Mountain API</h4>
    <br>
    <p>This project was developed using Node.js and Express.js, creating a REST API. The API empowers users 
        to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database containing mountain data.

    <br>
    <p>
        For our inaugural freestyle project, we centered our theme around "time." Our goal was to create a website 
        that offers intriguing facts about various inventions throughout history. Additionally, we 
        implemented an interactive game challenging users to guess the invention years. 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Invention Insights:</strong> The website provides users with educational content about historical inventions, highlighting their significance and evolution over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Guess-the-Year Game: </strong> Users engage in an entertaining game that tests their knowledge of invention timelines, adding an element of fun and learning.</li>
    </ul>
