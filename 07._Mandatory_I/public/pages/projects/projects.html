    <p>
        This project was created using Node.js and Express.js. It is a REST API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete mountains from a database.
        The API is hosted on VERCEL.

        This was our first freestyle project with the only requirement that it had to somewhat be about "time". I chose to make a website that gives your facts
        about random inventions. On top of that there is a game where one has to guess the right year of an invention.
