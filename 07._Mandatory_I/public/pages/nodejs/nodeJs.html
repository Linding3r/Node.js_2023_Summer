                In this exercise, you are introduced to two variables, firstName and lastName, which hold string values. The goal is to display a message in the
                console that combines these variables to form a sentence. The code showcases two methods of achieving this: using template literals and
                traditional string concatenation. Running this code will print your first and last name in two different way

                The second exercise provides two variables, year and number. Your task is to add the value of number to the value of year while adhering to the
                constraint that you cannot modify lines 1 or 2. To address this challenge, the code demonstrates three distinct methods of adding a number to a
                string: parseInt, Number, and unary + operator. The results are printed to the console.
